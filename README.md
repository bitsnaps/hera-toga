# Juno - a desktop app for Jupyter

[Latest Release](https://github.com/phildini/juno/releases)

Juno is a desktop app (currently only macOS) that opens Jupyter Notebooks
(.ipynb files) as a standalone app. No need to install python, conda, or jupyter.

## Some caveats

 - Right now, Juno only supports basic Jupyter. No addons or plugins (although 
   I'd love to to support more)
 - You might need to right-click on the app and select "Open" from the menu on 
   first run, since I haven't registered as a macOS developer yet.
 - THIS IS VERY ALPHA SOFTWARE. It works for me on my machine, and should work on
   yours. I _want_ it work on yours, so please file bugs, but I make no promises
   it does.
