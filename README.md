# Hera - a desktop app for Jupyter

**THIS IS VERY ALPHA SOFTWARE.**

[Latest Release](https://github.com/phildini/hera/releases/latest)

**Hera** is a desktop app (currently only macOS) that opens Jupyter notebooks
(`.ipynb` files) as a standalone app. A major benefit of Hera is that there is
no need to install python, conda, or jupyter.

## Some caveats

- Right now, Hera only supports [classic Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/jupyter/notebook).
  No add-ons, extensions, or plugins are currently supported (although we'd
  love to to support more)
- On first run of the app, you might need to right-click on the app and select
  "Open" from the menu since we haven't registered as a macOS developer yet.
- THIS IS VERY ALPHA SOFTWARE. It works for me on my machine, and should work on
  yours. We _want_ it work on yours, so please file bugs, but we make no promises
  it does.
